// Book Allocation Problem (by Binary Search)
/*
There are N books, each ith book has A[i] number of pages.

You have to allocate books to M number of students so that the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimum.

Note:-
@ Each book should be allocated to a student.

@ Each student has to be allocated at least one book.

@ Allotment should be in contiguous order.

Calculate and return that minimum possible number.

Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.

/*Certainly! Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the time and space complexity for each main part of your code:

1. isValid Function
Time Complexity:

The function iterates through all n books once: O(n).
Space Complexity:

Uses only a constant amount of extra space (for counters and variables): O(1).
2. Main Function
a. Input Reading and Summing Pages
Reading input and summing pages:
Both loops run n times: O(n) time, O(n) space for the nums vector.
b. Binary Search
Binary search loop:
The range for binary search is from st (0) to end (sum of all pages, call it S).
The number of iterations is O(log S).

Each iteration calls isValid (O(n)), so total time for binary search:
O(n * log S)

c. Overall
Total Time Complexity:

Input reading: O(n)
Binary search: O(n * log S)
Total: O(n * log S)
Total Space Complexity:

For nums vector: O(n)
Other variables: O(1)
Total: O(n)
